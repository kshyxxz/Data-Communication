# Analog_Modulation_Techniques

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of fundamental analog modulation techniques:

- `amplitudeModulation.m` — Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- `frequencyModulation.m` — Frequency Modulation (FM)

These scripts are intended for educational and experimental purposes in the field of analog communications.
